## TIC TAC TOE

This is a project that is under [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home)'s curriculum, which is to make a Tic Tac Toe website that everybody can play on.

There was an option to make user play with computer as well, but I just focused on making two players play against each other.

### LIVE DEMO

LIVE DEMO of the project can be seen at this [link](https://daegudude.github.io/TOP-TicTacToe/).

- Problem Solving

    - This is a little vague concept and maybe seen as unrelated, but this was super important thing I learned. To solve the problem, you should give it enough time to solve problems, and use pomodoro techniques. In that way, you are optimizing your brain to go back and forth between focused and diffuse mode, so you can see the problems from focused and wider perspective.

    - Do not rush, Do not focus to finish the task on the pomodoro session, FOCUS on giving the full effort

### Things to Improve

- How to actually get the job done in the given time

    - It took me almost a month to get this project done. I guess it is good that you are trying to make perfect, however it is also important how to get things done at the given time. Let's consider this at the next project.

- Use Git workflow properly

    - As program gets bigger and complicated, my git workflow needs to be more organised. However, I tend to find myself making git repository like a messy room. I will have to practice how to make a branch at the proper time, make a proper commit with a good message.
