## TIC TAC TOE

As a part of The Odin Project, I will be making a tic tac toe game that everybody can play in the browser. This time, there are things that I want to focus on.

    1. [PROBLEM SOLVING](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/problem-solving-javascript)
    2. USE AS LITTLE GLOBAL CODE AS POSSIBLE

RULES:
    - When you face problems, always hand write first
    - Use module and factory at least one time. Try to use them
    as many as possible
